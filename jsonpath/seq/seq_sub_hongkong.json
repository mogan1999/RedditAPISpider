However, the SAR has seen the peak of the flu outbreak this year earlier than expected, as many people have been vaccinated and wear masks.\n\n&gt;The recent warm weather with temperatures higher than 20 degrees Celsius also made the flu virus inactive, he added.\n\n&gt; Some patients who have been vaccinated still developed serious illnesses as the vaccines could only bring a 40 to 60 percent protection rate, Hui said.\n\nI find this train of reasoning disturbing - so there are multiple factors but the focus is on masks? They have their uses but healthy people shouldn't have to wear masks everyday.",

                "\nHONG KONG -- Teachers at Hong Kong schools are resigning at an accelerating turnover rate amid an embrace of mainland-style \"patriotic education\" by the government that is seen as chilling a once-open atmosphere.\n\nA total of 3,540 teachers at public primary and secondary schools have left before retirement so far in the year that began last September, the Education Bureau reports. That is already 28% higher than the full-year tally for the preceding year, and more than double the figure for 2020-21, before which annual totals had hovered around 1,300.\n\nThe spike follows China's 2020 national security law, which requires the territory to promote national security education to \"raise awareness.\" Schools have come under scrutiny as authorities see the widespread participation of middle and high schoolers in Hong Kong's mass street protests of 2019 as a failure of the education system.\n\nThe pro-Beijing camp was especially bothered by \"liberal studies,\" a subject influenced by the U.K. -- Hong Kong's former colonial ruler -- in which students discuss political and social issues to encourage critical thinking and broad perspectives.\n\nThis has since changed to \"citizenship and social development,\" which aims to instill patriotism and respect for the law by studying topics such as China's constitution. The shift abruptly invalidated the old curriculum, forcing teachers to adopt one closer to the mainland.\n\nA report last May by the Hong Kong Centre for International Student Assessment cited the \"overall social atmosphere\" and \"change of education policy\" as major reasons for teacher turnover in the 2020-21 year. This was a marked change from previous years, when factors such as job or promotion prospects dominated.\n\n\"Ever-changing education policies\" put a heavier burden on the teachers who remain, which \"may eventually accelerate further turnover of serving teachers,\" the report warned.\n\nEducation in the territory is becoming \"mainland-ified,\" argues Hong Kong political commentator Johnny Lau, who alleges that teachers are leaving because \"they don't want to be part of the brainwashing system.\"\n\nWhen asked by Nikkei, the Education Bureau attributed the increased turnover to \"overseas emigration and individual reasons.\" It did not answer a question about whether the new state education policies played a role.\n\n\"Students routinely attend flag-raising ceremonies with the Chinese flag, sing the national anthem and participate in quiz competitions on national security,\" said a teacher in her 40s at a public secondary school.\n\n\"Children are smart. Once they understand the changes in society, they loudly declare themselves 'patriots.' Eventually they'll either be brainwashed or stop caring\" about freedom, she said.\n\nIn his policy address in October, Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee said new public school teachers will be required to pass a test on the national security law. Kindergartens will receive grants for activities to help students learn Chinese culture, in an effort to foster a sense of belonging with China even before compulsory patriotic education begins in first grade.\n\nXia Baolong, head of the Chinese State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, emphasized education in an address Saturday for China's National Security Education Day. He warned that \"undercurrents\" of unrest remain -- alluding to the protests -- and told Hong Kongers to stay on guard against a return of violence in the streets.",

While economies benefit from the money spent, there is a general distain for their behaviour that has lead to a stereotype that I\u2019ve heard repeated in Canada, US, Australia, UK and in Europe and even in my neighbourhood in Tung Chung.\n\nThere seems to be a cultural practice of mainland Chinese people traveling in HUGE groups, often booking through a charter company that drives them around to key locations, lets people off to take pictures, and back on the bus. I\u2019ve had a lot of conversations about why this seems to be such a popular travel method for specifically Mainland Chinese and can\u2019t land on a reason. One theory I\u2019ve heard is that it makes travelling cheaper.\n\nAnother theory I\u2019ve heard is that it is a remnant of the Cultural Revolution and Chinese people feel safer in crowds of like minded people as a way to protect their national pride while being exposed the great things other countries have to offer. It is a way to keep each other in check but also give a way to brag that they\u2019ve \u201cseen the Colosseum but the Great Wall is better.\u201d Sort of like struggle sessions but with a modern take.\n\nThis is an interesting theory because it could explain some of the poor behaviour seen by these tour groups (touching artifacts, crossing under boundaries, talking loudly, spitting etc) because under the Cultural Revolution, even Chinese history was devalued under the \u201cFour Olds\u201d mandate from the 1960\u2019s. \n\nEither way, this \u201cherd\u201d style of travel is exactly opposite to the solo travel style valued in the \u201cwest\u201d where individuals break away from their own background to \u201cfind themselves\u201d. Cheesy and problematic as it can be, the \u201cwest\u201d values individual exploration to find out what from your background is worth keeping and how you can learn from others. Western tourists can be degenerates too and Bali is an endless source of inappropriate and disrespectful behaviour, but I think communities really resent huge lines of charter buses carrying 50+ Chinese tourists, following a guide with a flag around a spot for 30 minutes without giving even a moment consideration to interact individually with the environment they paid to visit.",

                "The Hong Konger is an incredible story of passion, dedication, and resilience, not only about Jimmy Lai but the people of Hong Kong. It's a powerful reminder of the importance of freedom and the people who work tirelessly to uphold it. It's vital that this message is shared far and wide to raise awareness of the situation in Hong Kong and to support those who are fighting for their rights and freedom.  \nBy watching and sharing the documentary, we can help amplify the voices of those who are being silenced and oppressed. We can help to raise awareness of the dangers facing journalists and media organizations around the world and the vital role they play in holding power to account.  \nSo please, watch the documentary, and share it with your friends, family, and colleagues. Let's spread the message far and wide and stand in solidarity with those who are fighting for their rights and freedoms. Together, we can make a difference.  \nAlso, many of you may have noticed the recurring motifs of birds and bird cages throughout.  \nIn reality, there was a big aviary located on the top floor of Apple Daily's building, right next to our staff canteen. After the Hong Kong police shut down Apple Daily, some of our colleagues discovered that the birds were still trapped inside the aviary. Without hesitation, they organized a daring rescue mission to save the birds.  \nThe production team had initially intended to include this heartwarming rescue in the documentary. However, out of concern for the safety of our colleagues, the scene was ultimately left out. This little act of kindness highlights the unique culture of Apple Daily; and I doubt there exists another company, let alone a media company, with employees so full of love.",

They called her weak and that she was making a lot of noice while reassuring the citizens of HK that negotiations went well.\n\nIn this documentary where they interview diplomats, advisors and her, it became clear that she actually was alone and had a hard stance to protect the people of HK against everyone elses advise. As you can see in the interview, she does reflect back on the negotiations and how she eventually (regrettably) had to give in and accept the final CCP proposal.  \n\n\nEdit: Spelling",

Many historians states that the powers of WW1 should have been tougher with Hitler and this appesement was a wrong move. It was not until much later as they claimed more and more land that France and Briton finally gave a red line warning right before the invation of Poland (they made a contract with Poland), that if Hitler invaded they would consider it an acto fo war and they would declare war upon Germany.\n\nMargaret Tatcher was a hard liner and was firmly against appesement against tyrants as it only emboldens them and other tyrants. One have to immediatly say no, and make it clear you cannot get your way with violence.  \n\n\nEdit: Spelling",

I'm working on my final this year which centers around a relative of mine who left Belgium and went to Hong Kong. He never came back, he still lives there but there is no contact. My project centers about his disappearance from my life and my \"place\" and how he lives a completely different life separate from mine, in a way that one could say he lives on a different planet. The angle I'm taking in this project is by focusing on the sky and the clouds. The way they look here and the way they change the further they go to a point that they will never be the same as they were here, symbolising the loss of a person that left and will never come back. A person whose lives are so separate from mine as clear as night and day (literally in this case).\n\nIf you have gotten this far, basically I'm looking for a person in Hong Kong with a camera. Preferably a canon or Nikon or anything like that, so not really a phone. For this project I want to show both my sky as well as the sky in Hong Kong, the clouds there and how one perceives their \"own\" sky. I know it's a bit vague right now and that's correct. I still have to make concrete plan on what I will do (even though the deadline is next Wednesday). The possibilities could be a livestream, a long take of the sky without the buildings, or the perspective of someone looking up (it's most likely going to be this one. For example my perspective looking up is simply dead trees and nothing else while I can imagine, even though I have never been there, the view in Hong Kong will feature buildings instead of trees, an interesting parallel to make in my opinion)\n\nAnyways, If u are interested in any way, let me know so I can give you more info.

I already appreciate you reading this. Thank you so much.\n\nPieter"

I think 90%+ of the HK population wouldn't know how to pronounce this, and would incorrectly pronounce it as \"\u6a02\" instead.\n\nAlso, with the correct pronounciation, name sounds like \"rubble\" (\u74e6\u792b)...\n\nSince I don't know your native name either, so can't really suggest alternatives. Oak is more commonly written/read as \"\u6a61\" `zoeng6` instead, however, this is character not so commonly used in name. It can also mean rubber (the material/plant).\n\nMore commonly used tree-themed characters include:\n\n* \"\u6a3a\" `waa6`, birch, most people would *incorrectly* pronounce it as `waa4` as with \"\u83ef\", to the extent it's probably taken for granted \n* \"\u6953\", `fung1` maple\n* \"\u69d0\", `waai4` ([see Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Styphnolobium_japonicum))\n* \"\u6a1f\" `zoeng1` ([see Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camphora_officinarum)).\n\nTree-themed names IMO are relatively old fashioned (millenials onward have less people baring such names, from the people I know).\n\nSide note: Judging from the fact that no one this pointing that \"\u6adf\" is a rare character and easily mispronounced, they probably didn't even know the pronunciation is incorrect. This phenomenom is known as \"\u6709\u908a\u8b80\u908a\", assuming the pronunciation of a character is pronounced the same as similar characters.\n\nSide note 2: There are some simple readability rules (that not everyone follows) when coming up with Cantonese names. A simple one is that a name , including the surname, should not consist of three consecutive non-flat tone characters. Flat tones are tones 1 and 4. It's because non-flat tones are harder to read in consecutive. And unlike Mandarin, there isn't a default rule to \"flatten\" the tone in such cases. Another rule is that a name should at least have one non-flat tone character, as that's a bit dull and not good for articulation.",
